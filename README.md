Scripts to be used with [BBEdit][]

[BBEdit]: http://barebones.com/bbedit

## Installation ##

These scripts should be installed to 

	~/Dropbox/Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts/

(Because you *are* using Dropbox, right? If not I think the path is `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts/` but I'm not sure because why would you not be using Dropbox?)

## Usage ##

The scripts can be found in BBEdit under the scripts menu:

![](bbedit-scripts-menu.jpg)

The filename will become the menu item name.

## What do they do? ##

Each script should have a `Purpose:` line at the top of the file.

[MMD to HTML.zsh][]
: Convert the current BBEdit file to HTML using [MultiMarkdown][].

## There are a few provisos, a couple of *quid pro quos*. ##

* I am not now, nor have I ever been, an employee of Bare Bones Software, Inc. and these scripts are in no way from or endorsed by Bare Bones Software, Inc. 
* These scripts come with no warrantee, guarantee, hint, implication, or other suggestion that any/all of them will work for you. You accept complete liability for anything that happens.
* Feel free to use, adapt, change, fix, modify, and re-release as you wish. Crediting me by name and/or linking to my Github (or other) page would be appreciated, but is not required. After all, they're only shell scripts, not the cure for cancer.
